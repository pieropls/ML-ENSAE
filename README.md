# **ðŸ¦¾Theoretical Foundations of Machine Learning**

## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**
This repository contains **tutorials and exercises** from the course *Theoretical Foundations of Machine Learning* at **ENSAE Paris**. It explores both theoretical and practical aspects of **modern machine learning**, including:
- **Regression and Overfitting** â€“ A look at balancing model complexity with generalization.
- **Model Selection & Penalization** â€“ Techniques to boost predictive performance while avoiding overfitting.
- **Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)** â€“ The core idea behind statistical learning.
- **Decision Trees & Neural Networks** â€“ Essential methods in supervised learning.
- **Reinforcement Learning & Deep RL** â€“ Strategies for learning through interaction in dynamic settings.
- **Unsupervised Learning** â€“ Clustering methods like PCA and their applications.  

*NB: Each concept is explained both intuitively and with full mathematical details in the notebooks.*

## **âš¡ Content**
#### âœ” [`A One-Dimensional Regression Problem`](1.1.A.one-dimensional.regression.problem.ipynb)
Explores regression techniques on a one-dimensional setting. **Linear regression** (limitations in capturing complex patterns, *e.g.* polynomial functions), **polynomial regression** (tendency toward *overfitting* for high-degree polynomials), **LASSO regularization** (manage model complexity by shrinking coefficients).

## **ðŸŽ“ Credits**
The course material is based on work by **Professor Vianney Perchet** â€“ [Website](https://vianney.ai/).
